# MaceCV To-Do list and Kanban

## To-Do
- [ ] Deploy to an actual phone  
- [ ] App: move labels to another layer and display on top of camera  
- [ ] App: refine confidence threshold for predicted sequences (unique)  
- [ ] Menu Screen  
- [ ] Record/Save video from app  
- [ ] Convert pure python into KV file  
- [ ] tech debt: clean up gen_data file with helper functions for repeat codesand bag

## In Progress
- [ ] Update comments in code for better readability  
- [ ] Update ReadMe for final presentation
